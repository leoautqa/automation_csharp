# Test Automation Project

This project is a **Test Automation Suite** developed in **C#** using the following tools and frameworks:

- **Selenium WebDriver** for browser automation
- **SpecFlow** for BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) testing
- **ExtentReports** for generating test result reports
- **NUnit** as the test runner
- **Magick.NET** for image manipulation (screenshots)

The project is designed to run tests on a web application and generate reports with detailed information about the test scenarios and their outcomes.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- **.NET SDK** (version 6.0 or higher, 8.0 recommended)
- **Visual Studio** (or any other preferred IDE for C# development)
- **Google Chrome** browser
- **ChromeDriver** (can be installed via NuGet)

### NuGet Packages

The following NuGet packages are required (defined in the `.csproj` file):

- `Selenium.WebDriver`
- `Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver`
- `SpecFlow`
- `SpecFlow.NUnit`
- `NUnit`
- `AventStack.ExtentReports`
- `Magick.NET-Q8-AnyCPU`
- `BoDi`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leoautqa/automarion_csharp
   cd test-automation
2. **Restore dependencies**:After cloning the repository, run the following command to restore all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
3. **Set up ChromeDriver**: Ensure that ChromeDriver is correctly installed through NuGet. The version of ChromeDriver should match your installed version of Google Chrome.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Features**: Contains the `.feature` files written in Gherkin syntax that define the test scenarios.
- **StepDefinitions**: Contains the implementation of the steps defined in the `.feature` files.
- **Hooks**: Contains the setup and teardown logic (e.g., initializing WebDriver, setting up ExtentReports).
- **Utilities**: Contains utility classes for taking screenshots and other helper functions.

## Running Tests

### Run all tests using the .NET CLI:

To run all the tests in the project, execute the following command:
```bash
dotnet restore
```
This will execute all scenarios defined in the `.feature` files and provide output in the terminal.

### Run tests in Visual Studio:

You can also run tests from Visual Studio:
1. Open the Test Explorer in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution to discover the tests.
3. Select and run individual tests or the entire suite

## Generating Reports

The project uses ExtentReports to generate detailed test result reports. After running the tests, the reports will be saved in the TestResults directory.

To view the report:
1. Go to the `TestResults` folder.
2. Open the HTML file generated by ExtentReports in a web browser.

The report includes:
- Test scenarios and steps
- Screenshots for failed test cases
- Pass/fail status for each test
